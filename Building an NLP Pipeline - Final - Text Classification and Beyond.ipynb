problem that would otherwise take a lot of our time whilst still creating the user experience we desire than well aim to do so. well try to keep our investments in a few toolsservices rather than having many ways to save the same problems, and are conscious of the number of innovation tokens we spend. its good to know what to expect and a little about how we do things currently, but theres

programmed for at least 2 years, preferably building web applications. you have good problem-solving and communication skills, both spoken and written. you are a quick learner and prefer picking up tools languages as needed for solving the problem at hand in the best way possible it helps if youve lived with the consequences of bad programming choices. you have an eye for spotting premature over-engineering that needlessly delays projects, but also notice when something that sounds fasteasytempting today will cost us severely in a few months. you understand that, ultimately, code is a means of solving the businesscustomer problems, and thrive in making the trade-offs that solve such problems efficiently.', 'what are you looking for in your next company? an open, friendly culture?

train, and deploy computer vision models. roboflow believes that computer vision is a foundation technology that will transform nearly every industry. we currently have over 250,000 users, including half of the fortune 100. roboflow has enabled our customers to accelerate cancer research, conduct experiments in space, accelerate the worlds transition to green energy, and improve the retail experience to name a few! with world-altering technology. investors like y combinator, david sacks craft ventures, lachy groom, the founders of openai sam altman and greg brockman, and many others back roboflow. as with any rapidly scaling startup, we hope to build a team that is both versatile and adaptable. each role has tremendous potential for growth. as such, we believe that coachability, enthusiasm, and an entrepreneurial mindset are more important than experience or qualifications. our goal is to build a magnetic environment for exceptional talent. what were looking for were looking for people that can own a large set of problems and are motivated by the question, how can i improve this? over 80 of our current team is a former founder and they love working at roboflow because they get to work autonomously and build solutions from the ground up but you dont have to be a former founder to thrive at roboflow!. roboflow is still early stage and each department runs a startup within itself that defines a problem, works with our customers, builds ideal solutions, and adapts quickly to changes. were looking for strong technical generalists to contribute to our core product and help us build the foundation for our rapidly expanding company. as an integral part of our early team, this role will inevitably involve wearing a lot of hats. wide-ranging curiosity and enthusiasm for diving into abstract problems, coming up with good solutions, and seeing them through to completion is essential. our core belief is that computer vision is a foundational technology that is going to transform nearly every industry. this is an opportunity to shape how millions of developers will experience and use it for the first time. your contribution will have a massive impact. what youll do youll be tasked with a wide range of projects. each engineer has a realm they focus on, but were still small enough that we dont have the luxury of deep specialization. were looking for technical generalists that arent afraid to dive into a new stack or toolchain if the need arises but javascript and node.js make up the brunt of the existing codebase. most of the things we work on are parts of the core product which is an end-to-end pipeline for building computer vision projects spanning from image ingestion to annotation to training and deployment but from time to time were also working on things like integrating marketing and sales tools, fighting fires, automating internal processes, and open source projects. youll have a wide degree of freedom to advocate for which projects you think should be highest priority and will contribute to our strategy decisions. if you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably wont be a good fit. the majority of our codebase is written in javascript, our machine learning and image processing pipeline is in python. we run primarily on firebase and gcs, with some machine learning infrastructure on aws. were increasingly using docker both internally and for customer facing products like our edge inference server. a lot of our code runs in the browser including some tensorflow js but were also working on building apis and client libraries in several languages. you certainly dont need to be experienced in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. we also hope youll bring some new knowledge and experiences you can share to help level-up the rest of the team. were especially keen to add some rigor to our processes and build the foundation for rapidly scaling the engineering organization for example we currently have limited tests and are not using an opinionated front-end framework -- things that will need to change over the coming months in order to be able to seamlessly expand the team. within one month, you will spend the first week onboarding in person with your manager youll come to our ny or sf hub! start building a trusting relationship with your peers, and learning the company structure. ship a substantial new feature to an end user within your first week build your first roboflow computer vision product if you havent already within six months, you will attend your first all company onsite be ramped up on other relevant parts of the roboflow product. who youll be working with we are currently a team of 30 team members located all over the us and europe. our teams backgrounds range from high school whiz kids that organized a student club, former founders of technology companies and fashion lines, cmos to ceos, and have experience scaling businesses to millions in revenue. we want to work with exceptional people with a diverse background. at this early stage, youll have the ability to work cross-functionally with many members of the team and solve a wide array of problems. you will directly be working with our engineering lead and a team of full stack engineers. where youll work roboflow is distributed across the us and europe. we currently have hubs in new york city, san francisco, des moines, and are open to opening more as we grow in different cities. we provide opportunities like team onsites in different cities and resources like a travel stipend to work in person with other team members as much as youd like, while also supporting remote team members. you can work from one of our hubs, work from home, work at a co-working spaces, etc. we want you to work where you work best! when youll work given that we are an remote company and can hire almost anywhere in the world, we dont have a particular time-zone preference for this role. however, you may need to be available for non-recurring urgent meetings outside of working hours. we have a flexible schedule that allows you to work collaboratively with other team members and asynchronously when needed. note customer facing roles will skew towards our customer base us timezones. level senior what youll receive to determine your salary, we use a number of market and data-driven salary sources. we review all salaries every 6 months to ensure we stay in line with the market. the target compensation for this role is 165,000 base salary in addition to our cash compensation, we offer generous perks and benefits. below are some of the highlights 2500 travel stipend to travel anywhere anytime to work with alongside other roboflowers 350 productivity stipend to spend on things that make your work environment more productive, like high speed internet at home or a co-working
