More about Pismo
Jump into the waves of transformation
Our story started in 2016, back on the California seaside, a place called Pismo beach.
The place was not only an inspiration to our name but also to how we see our contribution to the world.The smallest part of an ocean is a drop. Several drops together form waves. And waves are the energy of movement, of transformation. They represent the power of change in a fluid and organic way.
At Pismo, each of us are powerful drops embodying a huge wave of change in payments and banking.
Our core values
Responsibility  Commitment

Responsibility and Commitment are key tenets of Pismos business. In all of our interactions, ethics and honesty serve as guiding principles. Transparency and alignment are essential at Pismo to foster a culture of accountability where people do not take shortcuts and dare to be vulnerable. We encourage ownership and enable our employees to be a part of the solution to our challenges.

Challenging the Status Quo to Drive Change

Pismo is a disruptive company that knows we cant count on what got us here to get us where we want to go. Instead of following trends, our team members create them. We strive for the best solution for every situation, not the easiest. Taking the ordinary or common sense route is insufficient. This is how we affect real change.

Minimum Friction Experience   

Pismos success depends on fluid, clear, and careful internal and external communication. Our solutions should address issues directly rather than causing new ones. We understand that learning and development is a positive outcome of necessary friction. We want our customers and employees to have a pleasant experience free of bureaucracy.

Collective Power

Pismo isnt simply mine, yours, or some other teams. All of our people have a good purpose for being here. Each of us, in our way, has the freedom to be ourselves and know we are accepted. Pismo values being a multicultural organisation. We are stronger, more efficient, and happier when we operate as a team.

Delivering Value and Excellence

Constant development is essential as it allows us to supply high-quality products and services while ensuring that we always bring value to our clients. Pismo recognises the importance of new information in breaking down boundaries and forging new possibilities. We pave the way and set trends by developing market-leading solutions.

Focus on People

People are a companys most valuable asset. That is why we prioritise attracting and hiring the best people, followed by personal and professional development. We invest in peoples growth and empower them to take charge of their careers. We value work-life balance because we understand how difficult it can be to distinguish between work and life.
