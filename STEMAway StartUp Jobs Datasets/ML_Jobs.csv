You'll join Explosion as a machine learning (ML) solutions engineer in a new role focused on customer solutions and success. In this role, you'll work with our prospects (pre-sales) and customers (post-sales) to understand their goals and help resolve their issues using Prodigy and Prodigy Teams. 
We launched our first annotation tool product Prodigy Standalone in December 2017. The product has been extremely well received, with thousands of users in total and enough revenue for us to bootstrap the company up until 2021, when we took our first external funding to produce the SaaS version you'll also be working on: Prodigy Teams.
Curiosity, attention to detail, and methodical thinking will help you untangle customer issues, from coding up a solution to recording support videos to partnering with our internal engineering teammates for debugging sessions. You should be comfortable explaining complex concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences. You will be on the tools for some portion of this role, but building meaningful relationships with our customers and taking the time to connect with them and deeply understand their goals is also important.

About the company
Explosion is a tools company – specifically, developer tools for AI. We believe that technologies like Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision have commercial applications that are very broad, but somewhat shallower than what the most breathless hype of the last few years might suggest. We therefore see ""AI development"" as just another type of software development, like web development. ""Just"". That still makes it a pretty big thing, that will deliver lots of value into the world. But that value will be delivered by a large number of software developers working closely with the technology, spread out across all sorts of companies.
We want to provide something of value and get paid to do so. We do find the work itself interesting as well, and we hope to have a team who finds it interesting too, both because it will make everyone's days more pleasant, but also because it will lead to much better success.

https://startup.jobs/machine-learning-ops-engineer-patrick-j-mcgovern-foundation-4317401,"Engineer,Machine Learning",Machine Learning Ops Engineer,Patrick J McGovern Foundation ,,,"

The Patrick J. McGovern Foundation (PJMF) is a private foundation dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence and data science solutions to create a thriving, equitable, and sustainable future for all. PJMF works in partnership with public, private and social institutions to drive progress on our most pressing challenges, including digital health, climate change, broad digital access, and data maturity in the social sector.


For more information, please visit our website at https://www.mcgovern.org/. Core to PJMF’s mission is inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility (IDEA). We apply the IDEA framework to all we do, from growing a diverse team within the foundation to coalition building with organizations and people around the world, and to democratizing the development and rewards of AI and data. 



About the Role: 


PJMF’s Data Practice team connects nonprofit organizations worldwide with expert technical guidance and practical hands-on experience using advanced data approaches and tools that can simultaneously move a nonprofit forward on its data journey while unlocking new pathways to impact. The team’s approach is issue-, tech-, and region-agnostic, creating an open space for nonprofits to explore the data solutions best suited to their work, communities, and contexts – rather than limiting choices to the data solutions most accessible to them in the near term.

PJMF’s Data Practice seeks a civic-minded, socially-conscious, and industry-experienced MLOps Engineer to join its team of technical leads and program implementation specialists in supporting nonprofit grant partners as they progress their respective data journeys. Data Practice grant partnerships are high-touch engagements between nonprofit staff with varying levels of data expertise and experienced PJMF data practitioners with industry-level skill sets. Over the course of each calendar year, Data Practice operations run on two tracks: implementation of Data Practice programs with grant partners selected in the previous calendar year, and strategy development and selection of grant and implementation partners for the next calendar year. Data Practice technical and program staff collaborate closely to both select Data Practice partners and implement Data Practice programs.

In this role, you will join the team’s Data Scientist, Cloud Engineer, and Data Engineer as a Data Practice technical lead, providing a combination of ML/DevOps instruction, mentorship, and guidance to nonprofits seeking to explore the value of integrating advanced data tools and approaches into their work. The Data Practice’s MLOps Engineer will be expected to serve as a trusted advisor to individual grant partners, with a willingness to both troubleshoot acute data challenges and engage in the co-creation of solutions designed for longer-term impact.

Relationship management, facilitated by both technical leads and program implementation specialists on the Data Practice team, is critical to creating the trusted environment required to enable and document learning between the Foundation and its grant partners, and among the grant partners themselves. We seek candidates with sharp communication skills, patience, discretion, awareness of the contexts and constraints commonly experienced by nonprofits, and a commitment to knowledge capture and continuous learning. This position will report to the Director, Data Practice. 
How you will make an impact:

Advise grant partners on technology selection, software architecture design, security practices, and implementation, including productionization and scalable deployment of machine learning models and data-enabled applications
Regularly learn and implement new technologies, and play an active advisory role in developing, proving out, and (re)assessing solutions under exploration by grant partners
Lead scoping exercises with prospective and current grant partners on stability, application delivery, and availability
Maintain a strong security awareness through frequent software architecture design reviews
Keep up-to-date with latest developments in machine learning and DevOps,  particularly with regard to cloud services and the use of data technology by nonprofits, and share your knowledge with the Data Practice team and grant partners
Assist in evaluating the reliability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of machine learning models and work with grant partners to identify areas of improvement
Work with individual nonprofits to connect the gap from development to production for ML and natural language processing (NLP) models under the constraints of scalability, correctness, maintainability, and efficiency
Develop scripts and processes to optimize and automate ML and NLP models in production within the cloud and bring subject matter expertise about data storage and object-oriented programing
Develop strategies to track model performance and drift, identifying models that need to be retrained

What you will need to succeed:


""Data for Good"". Understanding of / interest in the use of responsible AI for international development or social/environmental impact work 


Knowledge and Expertise. MLOps experience automating processes, using data to make better decisions, using software to make processes more efficient, improving the quality of the product or service provided by an organization, and improving speed of delivery

Strategic Mindset. Systems thinker capable of analyzing and distilling observations, ideas, and feedback into team notes, memos, and slide presentations

We are advancing AI to power the future of medicine.

At Unlearn, our purpose is to advance artificial intelligence (AI) to eliminate trial and error in medicine. We use AI to simulate potential health outcomes for individual patients. Today, we are reimagining the randomized control trial (RCT) for the 21st century through AI-powered clinical trials or TwinRCT. A TwinRCT allows more trial patients to receive the experimental treatment, reaches full enrollment faster and put patients first. Unlearn’s innovative work in AI today will reinvent how AI is applied in medicine tomorrow—and we have a top secret plan for how to get there. We won’t be able to achieve this mission just by applying technologies created by others; the future must be invented.

Unlearn is a technology company, not a biotech company. We use computers, not pipettes. We make and use software, we don’t discover or make drugs. We believe that AI will define the future of medicine, and we aren’t deterred by naysayers or skeptics. 

We come from a variety of backgrounds ranging from machine learning to marketing—but regardless of where we come from, Unlearners share some common traits:

>> Unlearners are ambitious; we aren’t intimidated by big, challenging goals. 
>> Unlearners are disciplined experimenters; we break down our big goals into smaller chunks and meet as often as necessary to track our velocity and iterate quickly. 
>> Unlearners are gritty; we never give up, setbacks just make us try harder.
>> Unlearners are receptive to new ideas; in fact, we hate being stuck with the status quo. 
>> Unlearners are storytellers; sharing information with each other and with the world is super important, too important to be boring.  And, last but not least,
>> Unlearners are team-oriented; we put the mission first, the company second, the team third, and individuals last.

Founded in 2017 by a team of world-class machine learning scientists, we have raised venture capital from top tier investors such as Insight Partners, Radical Ventures, 8VC, DCVC, and DCVC Bio. We completed our $50 million Series B in April 2022. We are headquartered in San Francisco, CA and have an additional office in Boston, MA.

OXMAN

OXMAN is a hybrid Design and R&D company that fuses design, technology, and biology to invent multi-scale products and environments. The fusion of disciplines within our work opens previously impossible opportunities within each domain—allowing design to inspire science and science to inspire design.

At OXMAN, we question dominant modes of design that have divorced us from Nature by prioritizing humanity above all else (human-centric design). Although it is design that has caused this rift, we believe that design also offers the greatest opportunity to heal it.

We propose a Nature-centric approach that delivers design solutions by, for, and with the natural world, while advancing humanity. In this pursuit, we reject all forms of segregation and instead call for a radical synergy between human-made and Nature-grown environments.

This approach demands that we design across scales for systems-level impact. We consider every designed construct a whole system of heterogeneous and complex interrelations—not isolated objects—that are intrinsically connected to their environments. In doing so, we open ourselves up to moving beyond the mere maintenance toward the advancement of Nature.

Summary

OXMAN is seeking a Machine Learning Engineer to join an all-star interdisciplinary team of deep thinkers and brilliant makers. In this position, they will contribute to database management, data analysis, machine learning architecture, modeling, and validation efforts in our organization. The primary focus is to design, optimize, and deploy machine learning pipelines using large multimodal datasets (i.e., tabular data, images, structured/unstructured text, time series, audio, biological sequences, etc.), containing heterogeneous and complex information related to biology, design, and sustainability. Experience with the design of traditional machine learning techniques and neural networks, along with a strong understanding of deep learning and the ability to build ML architectures for real-world use is desired. Successful applicants embody stellar technical skills, hold the capacity to navigate and resolve uncertainty, and demonstrate a unique “language” of biology (wetware) / computing (software) / fabricating (hardware), or a combination thereof. They have produced and can present a prolific corpus of research; exemplify a passion for systems-based thinking with a wide range of potential applications for their work; personify an appreciation for engineering, science, and art; and seek synergy between biology and technology in research, practice, and direct industrial utility.

The Machine Learning Engineer will play a key role in researching and developing novel algorithms, models, and methods for solving unique challenges of prediction/inference, knowledge search, and reinforcement learning within a variety of biological and bio-inspired systems—from single-celled organisms to whole ecologies and even biotic-abiotic hybrid systems, where autonomous robots may interact with biological organisms.

Life is too short to work with people who don’t inspire you.  

We are a transparent workplace, where EVERYBODY has a voice in building OUR company, and where learning and growth is available to everyone based on their merits, not just on stamps on their resume. As impressive as some of the stamps on our resumes are, we recognize that human talent and passion exist everywhere, and come from many backgrounds, so stamps matter much less than results. All of us are dedicated doers and are highly energetic, focusing vehemently on execution because we know that the best learning happens by doing. We recognize that we are creating OUR COMPANY TOGETHER, which is not only a high-performing fast-growing business, but is changing the way the world perceives the quality of technical talent in Latin America. We are fueled by the great positive impact we are making in the places where we do business, and are committed to accelerating careers and investing in hundreds (and hopefully thousands) of highly talented data science engineers and data analysts. 

 In short, our business is about people, so we hire the best people and invest as much as possible in making them fall in love with their work, their learning, and their mission.  When not nerding out on data science, we love to make music together, play sports, play games, dance salsa, cook delicious food, brew the best coffee, throw the best parties, and generally have a great time with each other.

Grammarly is excited to offer a remote-first hybrid working model. Team members work primarily remotely in the United States, Canada, Ukraine, Germany, or Poland. Certain roles have specific location requirements to facilitate collaboration at a particular Grammarly hub.
All roles have an in-person component: Conditions permitting, teams meet 2–4 weeks every quarter at one of Grammarly’s hubs in San Francisco, Kyiv, New York, Vancouver, and Berlin, or in a workspace in Kraków. This flexible approach gives team members the best of both worlds: plenty of focus time along with in-person collaboration that fosters trust and unlocks creativity.


Grammarly team members in this role must be based in the United States or Canada, and they must be able to collaborate in person 2 weeks per quarter, traveling if necessary to the hub(s) where the team is based.

The opportunity 
Every day, tens of millions of people and 50,000 professional teams worldwide trust Grammarly's AI and human expertise to help ideate, compose, revise, and comprehend communications. Our team members have the autonomy to take on exciting challenges in pursuit of our mission to improve lives by improving communication. Together, we're building on more than a decade of steady growth and profitability. We're defining the communication assistance category with our tailored service offerings: Grammarly Free, Grammarly Premium, Grammarly Business, and Grammarly for Education.

Over the last few decades, technological innovation has relied on democratizing some of its key ingredients: knowledge (open publishing platforms), algorithms (code repositories) and computing (cloud providers). However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.


One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.


We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
 - are allergic to over-engineering.

 - are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.

- love playing board and video games.
 - are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results. 

 - are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.

 - have a sense of humor (well, we think we do).


As an early member of our ML engineering team, you will help
 - push the limits of cutting-edge computing and machine learning

 - build the team and drive the direction of the company.

 - shape our product and culture.

 - experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.


The following is a big plus
 - fluency in Python, Rust and PyTorch

 - experience with training and deploying models in multi-GPU environments

 - recognized open-source contributions

 - participation in competitive programming events (CTFs, Putnam, IOI, IMO, IPHO, Topcoder, Kaggle, etc.)

How to apply
 
Show your interest in any way that works for you; we simplified the application process - send us whatever you have or just your Linkedin and a brief message explaining why you are an excellent fit for this role.  

This is the process:

https://startup.jobs/senior-machine-learning-engineer-ml-ops-builderai-what-would-you-build-4538966,"Engineer,Machine Learning,Senior",Senior Machine Learning Engineer - ML Ops,Builder.ai - What would you Build? ,"London, United Kingdom",Full-Time,"

About us
Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.
We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.
Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.
Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.

Life at Builder
It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.
Our scale up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild

https://startup.jobs/lead-machine-learning-engineer-octopus_energy-4499148,"Engineer,Machine Learning",Lead Machine Learning Engineer,Octopus Energy ,"London, United Kingdom",Full-Time,"


Help us make a big green dent in the universe. We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.


Our team
All technology is written and maintained by a multi-discipline engineering team of around 300 people globally. Our engineers work in ‘super teams’ which are focused on key areas of our platform as well as other innovative products. This also includes server-side, client-side and mobile engineers working closely with UX experts, copywriters and designers. 
 
Teams are empowered to choose a way of working that works for them, often opting for a Kanban-like approach. Notion and Asana are then used to specify and manage work; Github, CircleCI and Terraform Enterprise as part of an immutable-infrastructure, continuous delivery pipeline; and Datadog, Sentry and Cloudwatch to measure performance and monitor production. 
 
We make sure that Kraken provides the right data to continually learn & improve. We use state of the art NLP to analyse customer messages, suggest actions and help to generate responses. We crunch billions of data points to train ML models to forecast each customer’s usage. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure and giving them lots of autonomy.

Our ML team consists of data scientists and front-end and back-end engineers, so that we can rapidly prototype and get innovative features in use in the platform at breakneck speed. 


We’re Charging Kraken to power utilities beyond energy (think water, broadband,..) and have created a new business Kraken Utilities. We are building this team from scratch and are looking for engineers for Kraken Utilities to help us build and scale the team, implement a good culture and work on some really exciting tech challenges. 


Together with the rest of the team, you will bring the same revolutionary customer experience, operational excellence and speed of innovation that Kraken is powering across energy retailers to other sectors.
What you'll do

We have lots of difficult design challenges to solve. The UK utilities market is complicated, outdated and process-heavy - there's an awful lot of domain modelling that we need to get right. Strong attention to detail is essential.
We have challenging technical problems to solve; like processing tens of millions of meter readings a day. We need the right technology in place to handle this smoothly as well as feeding data into a machine learning pipeline that models and predicts consumption. Or thinking about how we adapt Kraken to improve other utilities like water and broadband.
There's a great opportunity for disruption in the UK energy market. The big suppliers still dominate, but are not exactly popular. The energy landscape is changing as we move to more dis-aggregated forms of generation, with less predictability, more dynamism and smarter technology.
You'll be working for a company that’s fighting climate change. Our generation arm is the largest investor in solar generation in the UK, and is funding wind and anaerobic digestion. As a supplier, we're helping people to use greener technology and renewable energy, all helping move the UK towards a lower carbon future.


Our data stack..

AWS cloud infrastructure
Databricks Delta Lake for data lake and warehouse storage and querying
dbt for data modelling and transformations
Spark for large data processing
Python data ecosystem as main scripting and analytics language
Jupyter and Jupyter Hub for notebook analytics and collaboration
Airflow for task scheduling
Kubernetes for data services and task orchestration
MLflow for experiment and model management
Github, Circle CI, Grafana and Prometheus for version control, deployment and monitoring
Tableau and Streamlit as data front ends

Why else you'll love it here


Wondering what the salary for this role is? Just ask us! On a call with one of our recruiters it's something we always cover as we genuinely want to match your experience with the correct salary. The reason why we don't advertise is because we honestly have a degree of flexibility and would never want salary to be a reason why someone doesn't apply to Octopus - what's more important to us is finding the right octofit!
Octopus Energy is a unique culture. An organisation where people learn, decide, and build quicker. Where people work with autonomy, alongside a wide range of amazing co-owners, on projects that break new ground. We want your hard work to be rewarded with perks you actually care about! We won best company to work for in 2022, on Glassdoor we we're voted 50 best places to work in 2022 and our Group CEO, Greg has recorded a podcast about our culture and how we empower our people

We would prefer someone who can work in our London office on a hybrid basis, coming into the office 2 days a week. You do need to be able to work in the UK. 

We're very excited to be growing our team. We're looking for skills and experience to help shape and define the future of not only our team, but the wider business at a global scale. If you're reading this and grinning, please apply! There are huge challenges to tackle, and we need amazing people who are keen to get stuck in. 


If this sounds like you then we'd love to hear from you. 

Studies have shown that some groups of people, like women, are less likely to apply to a role unless they meet 100% of the job requirements. Whoever you are, if you like one of our jobs, we encourage you to apply as you might just be the candidate we hire. Across Octopus, we're looking for genuinely decent people who are honest and empathetic. Our people are our strongest asset and the unique skills and perspectives people bring to the team are the driving force of our success. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of any protected attribute.

Who we are
About Stripe
Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career. 
About the team 
Our Revenue and Finance Automation (RFA) suite gives businesses power over the entire life cycle of their cash flow. By coordinating billing, tax, reporting, and data services in one modern stack, Stripe’s revenue and finance automation suite eliminates the inefficiencies of legacy finance tools and supports revenue growth.
While the internet has been a boon to productivity, the gains have been uneven. Common financial processes like billing, tax, and quarterly reporting are still painfully inefficient and manual. They’re also typically spread across a dozen or more software tools. The result: one-third of finance leaders reopen their books at least once a quarter because of accounting errors, and half spend 10 hours a month manually correcting discrepancies.
Stripe’s RFA suite relieves those burdens by equipping finance leaders with revenue management tools that are as sophisticated as the businesses they run. The suite automates manual work and improves accuracy across the cash flow life cycle, from payments and billing to tax, reporting, and reconciliation.
 
Our portfolio is growing rapidly and we are expanding our RFA suite to serve the diverse spectrum of Stripe’s users, from brand new startups to public companies. Simultaneously we are investing in foundations for an extensible platform solution, including integrations with external systems that will let us scale our reach and capabilities by orders of magnitude over the next few years.

Tegus is the leading market intelligence platform for key decision makers. We power some of the world’s most well-respected institutional investors, corporations, and consultancies through the largest and most comprehensive database of primary and market information. Our products and services enable clients to discover unmatched insights and answers to the most challenging questions they face to help them make better informed decisions. (And because a job description can only contain a fraction of how we operate, click here to learn more about the Tech Team at Tegus!)


As a senior machine learning engineer at Tegus, your job will be to build product features powered by machine learning on top of our unique, proprietary datasets.  The core of this data is an ever-growing set of “expert interviews”--primary research conversations between financial analysts and domain experts, arranged by Tegus, who discuss the ins-and-outs of a particular company’s business.  In 2021, Tegus acquired BamSEC, adding a comprehensive database of SEC filings and earnings/events transcripts to the platform.  And last year, through our acquisition of Canalyst, we added custom financial models and cleaned financial time series data.

Because so much of this data is unstructured text, your work will lean heavily towards NLP and large language models.  While we make extensive use of OpenAI API’s, we plan to explore other vendors, future open source models, and perhaps even custom-trained or fine-tuned models.

As a team, we have already launched LLM-powered transcript summaries and a search/browse experience based on topic extraction.  A main focus of our upcoming work will be a chat agent for financial professionals that has access to all of our underlying datasets.

Our work is core to the future of the company.  You will join as one of the first hires, reporting to the VP of Machine Learning, and will help to set the culture and practice of how we do machine learning at Tegus.  You will also get to work on real business problems using some of the latest and most exciting tools and methods in the industry.
Responsibilities 

Collaborate with product managers and product engineers to prototype, build, and release features in the Tegus Platform that leverage the latest advances in machine learning applied to our proprietary dataset of financial text.
Write production python code in our internal machine learning packages and deploy production microservices.
Stay on top of the latest advances in machine learning, including reading and presenting research papers.
Influence how we architect and deploy our machine learning code and services.
Mentor and pair with one or more junior ML engineers.

Qualifications

Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative discipline or demonstrated experience working on data-intensive problems.
Preferred: Masters or PhD5 years of experience working in a data-intensive or machine learning role, with at least 2 of those years in an industry role.
Demonstrated experience training and deploying machine learning models with a preference towards NLP applications.
Deep experience in the python data and machine learning ecosystem, including experience with pytorch.
Familiarity with docker, python API frameworks like FastAPI, and software engineering best practices.
Preferred: Previous experience deploying microservices on kubernetes.
Practical, iterative, product-focused mindset over slower, methodical, research-minded approach.

Benefits & Perks

Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision plans. 
401K plan with an employer match.
Parental leave for all parents. 
All employees are granted equity through our Restricted Stock Units (RSU) Program. 
Unlimited paid vacation, flexible work hours, and 10 observed paid holidays per year.
Employer funded long-term disability. 
Fantastic culture with regular virtual company-wide events, including cooking classes, yoga, meditation and more.
Generous employee referral bonus program.
The opportunity to attend peer-nominated quarterly DEI events.
Working for a thriving, performance-based company that values promoting from within, career advancement and transparency.
Work from our state of the art office in the heart of Chicago’s Loop featuring standing desks, mother rooms, nursing parent neutral bathrooms, subsidized gym access, and full amenity floor.
Commuter benefits & a fully stocked kitchen with rotating snacks and beverages.

Striveworks: Better Models, Faster
The world has looked to data analytics to bridge the gap between floods of data and the struggle to use that data effectively to make timely, impactful decisions. Today, most organizations are awash in analytics that “aren’t quite right”—models that were developed too generally, or too slowly, to be effective in dynamic, fast-paced environments. Striveworks is simplifying ModelOps with a powerful and extensible platform that instantiates the data analytic process as code. 
Striveworks is trusted by leading Fortune 500 firms as well as leaders in the public sector as a primary solution for managing model development, monitoring, and governance—and ensuring those models solve the real challenges their organizations face.
Striveworks’ Chariot platform enables users to turn their own production data into models and turn models into production systems. Uniquely, as you train, test, deploy, and use models, our lineage system enables you to track not only the “upstream” provenance of model and data sources, but also the “downstream” usage of the resultant model inferences. Combining this with a principled experience for data and model development, Chariot gives our customers in highly regulated industries an unmatched governance solution over the top of a performant ModelOps platform. 
Striveworks is an Equal Opportunity Employer and does not discriminate in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, belief, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity or expression), national origin, social or ethnic origin, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, genetic information, age, membership in an employee organization, retaliation, parental status, military service, or other non-merit factor. Striveworks will not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind.

Found is a modern weight care platform and community focused on integrated support. According to a recent CDC study, nearly 50% of Americans want to lose weight, and on average, Americans have gained 30 lbs during the pandemic. But the existing weight loss industry focuses on shame - if you don’t have the willpower to eat less and workout more, you aren’t trying hard enough.
Modern science shows us that weight care is complex - food and movement are important, but so are hormones, genetics, sleep, stress, mental health, and daily habits. Found's unique approach incorporates resources and tools for behavior changes, a digital app with guided programming, an online community, and if indicated, medical and prescription solutions.
Research shows that addressing weight health reduces the long-term risk of diabetes, heart disease, and some forms of cancer. We believe in giving our community tools that will help them add years to their lives and reach their goals.  We believe it’s not just what you’ve lost, it’s what you’ve Found.  Found has raised more than $130mm from leading investors, including Atomic, GV, WestCap, IVP, TCG, Define Ventures and more.

Who We Are

Roboflow is a venture-backed SaaS startup that empowers innovators all over the world to build, train, and deploy computer vision models. Roboflow believes that computer vision is a foundation technology that will transform nearly every industry. We currently have over 250,000 users, including half of the Fortune 100. Roboflow has enabled our customers to accelerate cancer research, conduct experiments in space, accelerate the world’s transition to green energy, and improve the retail experience (to name a few!) with world-altering technology. Investors like Y Combinator, David Sack’s Craft Ventures, Lachy Groom, the founders of OpenAI (Sam Altman and Greg Brockman), and many others back Roboflow. 

As with any rapidly scaling startup, we hope to build a team that is both versatile and adaptable. Each role has tremendous potential for growth. As such, we believe that coachability, enthusiasm, and an entrepreneurial mindset are more important than experience or qualifications. 

Our goal is to build a magnetic environment for exceptional talent. 

What We're Looking For 

We’re looking for people that can own a large set of problems and are motivated by the question, “How can I improve this?” Over 80% of our current team is a former founder and they love working at Roboflow because they get to work autonomously and build solutions from the ground up (but you don't have to be a former founder to thrive at Roboflow!). Roboflow is still early stage and each department runs a startup within itself that defines a problem, works with our customers, builds ideal solutions, and adapts quickly to changes.

What You'll Do

Roboflow is hiring our first research engineer on the machine learning team to drive research initiatives that improve the growing suite of machine learning tools that underpin the Roboflow application. Roboflow is actively used by thousands of engineers and it is now imperative for us to keep our machine learning tooling at the cutting edge and to push the state of the art forward in the ways that we are uniquely positioned, given the breadth of computer vision applications that our product is capturing.

This role will involve adapting and extending open source machine learning technologies into usable and scalable software. Wide-ranging curiosity and enthusiasm for diving into abstract problems, coming up with good solutions, and seeing them through to completion are essential responsibilities.

Our core belief is that computer vision is a foundational technology that is going to transform nearly every industry. This is an opportunity to shape how millions of developers will experience and use it for the first time. Your contribution will have a massive impact.


📅 Within one month, you will…
Spend the first week onboarding in person with your manager (you'll come to our NY or SF Hub!)
Start building a trusting relationship with your peers, and learning the company structure.
Ship a substantial new feature to an end user within your first week
Build your first Roboflow computer vision product (if you haven't already)

📅 Within six months, you will…
Attend your first all company onsite 

Be ramped up on other relevant parts of the Roboflow product.

Who You Are

You are a curious self-starter who wants to be part of an exceptional team, with a focus on using Roboflow's computer vision tools to impact and improve every industry.


On the machine learning team, we primarily work on building and maintaining technology within Roboflow’s training, search and deployment services, but from time to time we're also helping deliver on enterprise contracts, and coding awesome open source projects and sample projects. We currently support the fine-tuning and deployment of object detection, classification, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation models. In the beginning, you will be executing on research initiatives that we have embarked on with partner organizations - centered around the Roboflow 100 object detection benchmark. As we discover results within these initial projects, the role will branch into your own curiosities in the intersection of computer vision research, AI research, and the Roboflow application. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably will not be a good fit.


We’re especially keen to add someone to our team who has deep experience and passion in the field and will help us live on the frontier of computer vision technology.

Who You'll Be Working With

We are currently a team of 30 team members located all over the US and Europe. Our team’s backgrounds range from high school whiz kids that organized a student club, former founders of technology companies and fashion lines, CMOs to CEOs, and have experience scaling businesses to millions in revenue. We want to work with exceptional people with a diverse background. At this early stage, you'll have the ability to work cross-functionally with many members of the team and solve a wide array of problems. 

You will directly be working with our Machine Learning Lead and a team of Machine Learning Engineers.

Where You'll Work

Roboflow is distributed across the US and Europe. We currently have Hubs in New York City, San Francisco, Des Moines, and are open to opening more as we grow in different cities. We provide opportunities (like team onsites in different cities) and resources (like a travel stipend) to work in person with other team members as much as you'd like, while also supporting remote team members. You can work from one of our Hubs, work from home, work at a co-working spaces, etc. We want you to work where you work best! 

When You'll Work

Given that we are an remote company and can hire almost anywhere in the world, we don’t have a particular time-zone preference for this role. However, you may need to be available for non-recurring urgent meetings outside of working hours. We have a flexible schedule that allows you to work collaboratively with other team members and asynchronously when needed. Note: Customer facing roles will skew towards our customer base US timezones.

Level
