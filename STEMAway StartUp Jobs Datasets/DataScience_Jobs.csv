You will also partner closely with our Data Science Platform team. The Data Science Platform team looks for the common denominator across the Product verticals, and creates the scale required to support the Applications team.

This is a relationship driven role. We are looking for someone who has experience in and enjoys cross-functional partnerships, and has a track record of influencing partners to use data-capabilities to deliver value faster. We are a company with ambitious goals, and are looking for someone who will accelerate our delivery of clinical outcomes, healthcare cost savings, member experience, and gross margin. This manager will start with 5-6 direct reports and grow the team as the company grows. Included Health has a strong culture of personal development and we are looking for leaders with a track record of coaching and mentoring their teams. 
Responsibilities

A desire to work with a diverse, driven team to help improve clinical outcomes for hundreds of thousands of members
Ambitious, humble, people smart, and problem smart
At least 3 years of experience managing a Data Science team
Strong technical background in Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics or related field

Project Examples

Example 1 Think about the last time you had a basic insurance coverage question. How long did you wait on hold? Was the question answered? Did the answer make senseresolve your need? Accessing and paying for care often seems unnecessarily difficult. We are trying to create automatedself-serve experiences to quickly, easily, and accurately get basic healthcare logistics questions answered. Using Natural Language Processing to understand a members question and Large Language Models to generate responses to questions, we aim to make what should be painless in healthcare, painless. 

Example 2 Not all members want or need the same healthcare experience. A relatively healthy member wants a quick and easy experience. Members with rising risks may want more education about their options. High risk members may need help with complex care management. We use various methods to segment members in order to understand their risk profile and journeys. Then we partner with our various Product teams to determine where we can apply personalization through our products to cater the experience to each member.

A system thinker who intuitively understands data and defines success well before diving into algorithms.

What youll be doing 

Dont start from scratch. Draw from years of data engineering excellence and a treasure trove of meaningful quality data you can model on from day one. Iterate with boring technology and keep it simple. Snowflake, Python, Pytorch, Scipy, XGBoost. Youll start introducing more complexity where it makes sense.
Build prototypes based on smart assumptions in three days instead of planning to outperform the SoTA in three months.
Understand our rich internal Recommendations-ML-Engine to pull from. Work on classical non-linear optimization problems through tabular modeling, forecasting, normalization, and NLP. 
Steal liberally from basic research instead of attempting it yourself.


While a solid technical background is crucial, we are looking for someone who is not just a scientist or nerd but also can think strategically and work effectively with different stakeholders in JustWatch. If you have the personality, skills, and experience we are looking for, and if you are genuinely excited about the opportunity to drive business growth through machine learning and data science, we want to hear from you!

Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. Thats why only 16 of projects were ever done on budget and 78 failed.
Were changing that. Were flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ais platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem youre trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life  ANYONEs world-class ideas.
Building software needs to be like ordering pizza  pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till its cooked and ready for you.
Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run  scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.
Life at Builder

 Unlearners are receptive to new ideas; in fact, we hate being stuck with the status quo. 
 Unlearners are storytellers; sharing information with each other and with the world is super important, too important to be boring.  And, last but not least,
 Unlearners are team-oriented; we put the mission first, the company second, the team third, and individuals last.

Founded in 2017 by a team of world-class machine learning scientists, we have raised venture capital from top tier investors such as Insight Partners, Radical Ventures, 8VC, DCVC, and DCVC Bio.

The company  vision.
Everyones got the message machine learning is changing everything. And for Fortune 500 brands in every vertical, its actually true  ML predictions are solving billion-dollar, migraine problems. But for smaller brands, the talent and investment needed to build an ML platform are simply out of reach.  

Black Crow is changing that--fast. Founded by a team that has spent the last decade in machine learning, our mission is to help DTC brands turbocharge their growth by delivering bespoke, Fortune 500-grade ML predictions.  It works out of the box, delivered as a service, and costs less than one data scientist. Integration one click. 

12 months ago, we had one DTC brand using our predictions.  Now we have over 150  including Solo Stove, SAKARA, Native, Keurig, and Bearaby. There are 50,000 more who havent heard of us yet.

The team  culture. 
This is the 3rd company Black Crows founders have started together. Both previous companies scaled to 100MM and were voted Best Places to Work in NYC many times.
