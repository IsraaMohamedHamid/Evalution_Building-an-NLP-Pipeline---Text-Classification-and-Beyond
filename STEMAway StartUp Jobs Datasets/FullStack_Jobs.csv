At Factored, we believe that passionate, smart people expect honesty and transparency, as well as the freedom to do the best work of their lives while learning and growing as much as possible. Great people enjoy working with other passionate, smart people, so we believe in hiring right, and are very selective about who joins our team. Once we hire you, we will invest in you and support your career and professional growth in many meaningful ways. We hire people who are supremely intelligent and talented, but we recognize that intelligence is not enough. Perhaps more importantly, we look for those who are also passionate about our mission and are honest, diligent, collaborative, kind to others, and fun to be around. Life is too short to work with people who dont inspire you.  

We are a transparent workplace, where EVERYBODY has a voice in building OUR company, and where learning and growth is available to everyone based on their merits, not just on stamps on their resume. As impressive as some of the stamps on our resumes are, we recognize that human talent and passion exist everywhere, and come from many backgrounds, so stamps matter much less than results. All of us are dedicated doers and are highly energetic, focusing vehemently on execution because we know that the best learning happens by doing. We recognize that we are creating OUR COMPANY TOGETHER, which is not only a high-performing fast-growing business, but is changing the way the world perceives the quality of technical talent in Latin America. We are fueled by the great positive impact we are making in the places where we do business, and are committed to accelerating careers and investing in hundreds and hopefully thousands of highly talented data science engineers and data analysts. 

In short, our business is about people, so we hire the best people and invest as much as possible in making them fall in love with their work, their learning, and their mission.  When not nerding out on data science, we love to make music together, play sports, play games, dance salsa, cook delicious food, brew the best coffee, throw the best parties, and generally have a great time with each other.

https://startup.jobs/full-stack-engineer-packfleet-4533422,"Engineer,Full Stack",Full Stack Engineer,Packfleet ,"London, United Kingdom",Full-Time,"

Were looking for a full-stack engineer to join our team. Youll be pragmatic, have a great product-mindset, keeping users at the heart of how you think, and have a passion for great UI and UX. You already have past experience of frontend development with React and are comfortable writing code that runs on the backend too.
Were on a mission to empower independent businesses across the UK to offer the best deliveries on Earth, saving them time, money and stress, and making their customers the happiest they can be.
With the various surfaces our product touches, from merchants with the merchant dashboard, to consumers through our tracking page and drivers  operations with our routing  driver app, youll be able to have an impact on a wide range of users, and in areas where there is incredible potential to improve upon the industry status quo and delivery a truly wonderful experience.
Youll be able to be flexible, switching between working on the frontend or the backend when needed even being excited for going out to do deliveries with a driver, visiting merchants, handling packages within the depot, and moving beyond engineering when needed to to help the business and gain a first hand understanding of the problems youre trying to help solve.
As an early engineer, this is a unique opportunity for you to help shape what we build, and the way we build it. Theres still so much to do and learn, in every aspect of Packfleet  were only just beginning our journey!
What youll be doing day to day
 Building new features in our product that improve the lives of our merchants, recipients, drivers or our internal operations or all of the above! Chatting with folks in the team about how we should build something, fix an interesting issue, or design a feature, whether theyre an engineer or a designer or operations manager Improving our tooling or infrastructure as needed to make it easier for us to debug issues or scale as we have more users Sharing your opinions on designs, goals, operational problems, hiring, etc. and giving feedback to others to help us do the best we can Chatting with users to gather feedback or help them solve issues theyre having to improve our product for everyone Occasionally getting hands-on, going out with drivers to do deliveries or handling packages in the depot, to get an end-to-end understanding of the problems were trying to solve Getting the opportunity to input into other areas of the business that interest you, whether thats helping on sales, refining our operations, or anything else 

 Engineering at Packfleet
For our tech stack weve leaned on a combination of Rust where speed matters, and TypeScript where developer productivity is more important. We have a well-sized services approach which gives us flexibility to use the right language for the job, which unlike microservices the number of services grows slowly over time.
For our backend infrastructure we use Google Cloud Platform and Google Kubernetes Engine GKE to orchestrate our services. We make use of code generation and type-safe, language-agnostic interfaces like protobuf and GraphQL as much as we can. Using continuous deployment running on Github Actions, we deploy our backend dozens of times per day.
We tend towards paying for tools or services as opposed to building them ourselves, if we can put money towards a problem that would otherwise take a lot of our time whilst still creating the user experience we desire than well aim to do so. Well try to keep our investments in a few toolsservices rather than having many ways to save the same problems, and are conscious of the number of innovation tokens we spend.
Its good to know what to expect and a little about how we do things currently, but theres plenty to improve and the mindset you bring is far more important than your familiarity with our tech stack or tools. So if youre not so familiar with some of the tools or languages then dont let that dissuade you, your way of thinking and experience is much more important.

 Logistics
This role is based at our officedepot in Bermondsey, London. We currently work in a hybrid set-up, where we aim to spend at least 2 daysweek together in the office and working remotely the rest of the time, keeping us close to the drivers in the team and the physical elements of our business whilst also giving flexibility for remote working.

 How to apply
You can apply here in just a few minutes, and if you have any questions or queries youre welcome also to drop an email to jobspackfleet.com as well. We are able to sponsor visas for this role.

 Our commitment to diversity
We care deeply about creating a diverse team so we particularly encourage applications from people from different underrepresented demographics and encourage you, regardless of your background and past experience, to apply if the role excites you.
If we want to solve problems for people across the UK and one day around the world, our team has to represent those were solving them for. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them.
Requirements
You should apply if
 Youre excited about what were doing! Were a technology company working in a very traditional industry and that gives us a huge opportunity to build something truly different. Youre comfortable getting hands-on in a very early stage startup environment. Were still a small team and so youll be involved in everything. You have experience building web apps in React, and are comfortable writing code that runs on the backend too  having experience with Typescript here is a plus. You care about the users we are creating products for, being happy to speak to them directly, and love turning designs into beautiful products. You are comfortable in the face of ambiguity and are happy to take on problems without a clear definition or solution. You are comfortable putting something out there when its not-perfectly-polished to gather feedback, whether thats an MVP of a feature, a draft of a proposal, or your thoughts on a design. You care about the team and culture we are building, and understand the importance of giving feedback and supporting others around you. 
 
Benefits
What youll get
 A competitive internally-transparent salary and stock options in Packfleet, with the choice to trade-off salary for additional stock options on signing. The range for this role, based on levelseniority and salary trade-off, is 60,000 - 110,000 alongside meaningful equity.

Who We Are

Roboflow is a venture-backed SaaS startup that empowers innovators all over the world to build, train, and deploy computer vision models. Roboflow believes that computer vision is a foundation technology that will transform nearly every industry. We currently have over 250,000 users, including half of the Fortune 100. Roboflow has enabled our customers to accelerate cancer research, conduct experiments in space, accelerate the worlds transition to green energy, and improve the retail experience to name a few! with world-altering technology. Investors like Y Combinator, David Sacks Craft Ventures, Lachy Groom, the founders of OpenAI Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, and many others back Roboflow. 

As with any rapidly scaling startup, we hope to build a team that is both versatile and adaptable. Each role has tremendous potential for growth. As such, we believe that coachability, enthusiasm, and an entrepreneurial mindset are more important than experience or qualifications. 

Our goal is to build a magnetic environment for exceptional talent. 

What Were Looking For 

Were looking for people that can own a large set of problems and are motivated by the question, How can I improve this? Over 80 of our current team is a former founder and they love working at Roboflow because they get to work autonomously and build solutions from the ground up but you dont have to be a former founder to thrive at Roboflow!. Roboflow is still early stage and each department runs a startup within itself that defines a problem, works with our customers, builds ideal solutions, and adapts quickly to changes.

Were looking for strong technical generalists to contribute to our core product and help us build the foundation for our rapidly expanding company.

As an integral part of our early team, this role will inevitably involve wearing a lot of hats. Wide-ranging curiosity and enthusiasm for diving into abstract problems, coming up with good solutions, and seeing them through to completion is essential.

Our core belief is that computer vision is a foundational technology that is going to transform nearly every industry. This is an opportunity to shape how millions of developers will experience and use it for the first time. Your contribution will have a 
massive impact.

What Youll Do

Youll be tasked with a wide range of projects. Each engineer has a realm they focus on, but were still small enough that we dont have the luxury of deep specialization. Were looking for technical generalists that arent afraid to dive into a new stack or toolchain if the need arises but JavaScript and Node.js make up the brunt of the existing codebase.

Most of the things we work on are parts of the core product which is an end-to-end pipeline for building computer vision projects spanning from image ingestion to annotation to training and deployment but from time to time were also working on things like integrating marketing and sales tools, fighting fires, automating internal processes, and open source projects.

Youll have a wide degree of freedom to advocate for which projects you think should be highest priority and will contribute to our strategy decisions. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably wont be a good fit.

The majority of our codebase is written in JavaScript, our machine learning and image processing pipeline is in Python. We run primarily on Firebase and GCS, with some machine learning infrastructure on AWS. Were increasingly using Docker both internally and for customer facing products like our edge inference server. A lot of our code runs in the browser including some Tensorflow JS but were also working on building APIs and client libraries in several languages.

You certainly dont need to be experienced in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. We also hope youll bring some new knowledge and experiences you can share to help level-up the rest of the team.

Were especially keen to add some rigor to our processes and build the foundation for rapidly scaling the engineering organization for example we currently have limited tests and are not using an opinionated front-end framework -- things that will need to change over the coming months in order to be able to seamlessly expand the team.

 Within one month, you will
Spend the first week onboarding in person with your manager youll come to our NY or SF Hub!
Start building a trusting relationship with your peers, and learning the company structure.
Ship a substantial new feature to an end user within your first week
Build your first Roboflow computer vision product if you havent already
 Within six months, you will
Attend your first all company onsite 

Be ramped up on other relevant parts of the Roboflow product.

Who Youll Be Working With

We are currently a team of 30 team members located all over the US and Europe. Our teams backgrounds range from high school whiz kids that organized a student club, former founders of technology companies and fashion lines, CMOs to CEOs, and have experience scaling businesses to millions in revenue. We want to work with exceptional people with a diverse background. At this early stage, youll have the ability to work cross-functionally with many members of the team and solve a wide array of problems. 

You will directly be working with our Engineering Lead and a team of Full Stack Engineers.

Where Youll Work

Roboflow is distributed across the US and Europe. We currently have Hubs in New York City, San Francisco, Des Moines, and are open to opening more as we grow in different cities. We provide opportunities like team onsites in different cities and resources like a travel stipend to work in person with other team members as much as youd like, while also supporting remote team members. You can work from one of our Hubs, work from home, work at a co-working spaces, etc. We want you to work where you work best! 

When Youll Work

Given that we are an remote company and can hire almost anywhere in the world, we dont have a particular time-zone preference for this role. However, you may need to be available for non-recurring urgent meetings outside of working hours. We have a flexible schedule that allows you to work collaboratively with other team members and asynchronously when needed. Note Customer facing roles will skew towards our customer base US timezones.

Level
Senior

What Youll Receive

To determine your salary, we use a number of market and data-driven salary sources. We review all salaries every 6 months to ensure we stay in line with the market.

 The target compensation for this role is 165,000 base salary
 In addition to our cash compensation, we offer generous perks and benefits. Below are some of the highlights

At in99, we are known for being one of the few fully distributed companies in the world. Currently, it is estimated that only 16 of companies operate in this way. A distributed company is one in which there are no central offices.

Selection process 
From the very beginning, we want you to understand how we conduct our selection processes. The decision to onboard new members and the selection process rests with the teams, without interviews or Human Resources. To facilitate this work, we have created a two-phase process.
First phase automated It is simpler and highly automated, characterized by the following milestones
  Bryq Assessment with this test, we aim to eliminate bias and subconscious prejudices from our selection process, objectively assessing certain aspects of your personality and cognitive abilities.   Solo Challenge in this phase, we will invite you to undertake a challenge that allows us to evaluate your specific knowledge related to the position. 
Second phase interactive From this point forward, we will interact directly with you and invite you to an online collaborative session with the team members to solve a hypothetical problem in the following manner
  Async Challenge the majority of our interactions are asynchronous. In this phase, we strive to realistically replicate asynchronous interactions with your potential future teammates, allowing you to experience our way of working on a hypothetical problem and mutually assess the fit.

Sync Challenge after resolving the given problem, if necessary, we will invite you to participate in a video conference with the team to collectively discuss the solution reached in a brief workshop. 
We firmly believe that the distributed model can only work based on a relationship of utmost trust among all the project stakeholders. The challenge we face is that the project can be vulnerable to any misuse of that trust and freedom by any member. That is why you may find that our selection process includes more phases and takes longer than other processes you may have experienced in the past.
Distributed work within a relationship of complete trust, freedom, and responsibility remains a minority experience that has many positive aspects but also challenges to overcome. The objective is to provide both candidates and team members who will work directly with the finalists with the most comprehensive information, using a work experience as close to reality as possible, so that both parties can make the most informed decision.
If you feel that our mission and purpose resonate with you, that our working methodology aligns with your expectations, and you believe we can mutually contribute to this great project, we will be delighted to get to know you!

Our goal is to build a magnetic environment for exceptional talent. 

What Were Looking For 

Were looking for people that can own a large set of problems and are motivated by the question, How can I improve this? Over 80 of our current team is a former founder and they love working at Roboflow because they get to work autonomously and build solutions from the ground up but you dont have to be a former founder to thrive at Roboflow!.

Technology

Our goal is to build the worlds best computer vision infrastructure so our users dont have to. This means we handle a lot of challenging complexities like seamlessly ingesting dozens of data formats, processing tens of millions of images per day, and deploying auto-scaling machine learning infrastructure that can handle our customers most demanding training and deployment needs.

Our core app sits atop Firebase with assistance from auto-scaling groups of Docker containers for jobs like archiving datasets and training models. We also heavily lean on serverless infrastructure so we can gracefully deal with bursty traffic involved in manipulating datasets that can range anywhere from one hundred to one million images.

Our machine learning infrastructure runs in AWS, with a few deployments spanning into GCP. We train and deploy various state of the art models in a variety of machine learning frameworks. All of our machine learning applications are closely integrated with the core Roboflow web application.


We also maintain a library of Colab notebooks our customers can use to train common computer vision models, a directory of public datasets, and a web of format specifications. We see building and supporting mini-projects like these that are helpful to the community at large as part of our role in democratizing computer vision.

Who we are
About Stripe
Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companiesfrom the worlds largest enterprises to the most ambitious startupsuse Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyones reach while doing the most important work of your career.
About the team
The Support Experience engineering teams build and improve Stripes support experience, from end to end how users get help within our products, how they get in touch with us when they have questions, and how our teams use internal tools to answer those questions. Were accountable for the quality and reliability of this support stack and we use data and firsthand user research to continuously improve it. 
Performance and reliability is paramount, as we aim to meet industry leading support uptime. We also have major levers to reduce cost, and we do so by leveraging technology such as LLMs and AI to automate workloads, summarize cases, improve routing of cases to the best agents for a particular issue, recommend solutions to agents and users, and much more. Support at Stripe is incredibly complex, as we offer countless products and ways to use them together, so there is no one size fits all solution and our team is full of creative, ambitious, full stack problem solvers. 
We are hiring for two small distributed teams of capable, friendly, user-oriented engineers that partner closely with Stripes world-class design, product, infrastructure, and operational teams. These two teams work closely together, and even share some responsibilities, to provide a world class support stack. Providing great support to users of all sizes is culturally important to everyone at Stripe.
The Merchant Experience team focuses on the entry points that users access whenever they need support. This includes but is not limited to the external-facing support interfaces httpssupport.stripe.com, content, entry points chat, call, email, integration with third parties, and helping product teams reduce support volume. The team is highly cross functional and collaborates with other product teams at Stripe to improve support experience within the product.
The Agent Platform engineering team focuses on the internal guts of support case routing, enrichment, data privacy, customer satisfaction, and UI tools that agents use to solve user problems - to name a few. The team builds and operates a platform that Stripe product teams integrate with to securely and seamlessly expose workflows and insights to agents and users. We manage the observability, performance, and integration ease of use of this platform, to provide a simple interface for agents to help our users. 
What youll do
As a Fullstack Engineer on the Support Products team, you will build engaging, responsive user interfaces that make it truly enjoyable to get help from Stripe.
You will have the opportunity to scale the contact platform that connects Stripe users with the teams that are best equipped to help them. This might involve implementing new API endpoints for use across multiple products, iterating on data pipelines to maximize visibility into our support operations, or adding to our billing pipeline so that we can offer paid support plans in new regions. It might also mean exploring the feasibility of automating a support workflow or question with AI using LLMS or other advanced automation technologies. Or finding creative ways to partner with a product team to improve a particular support workflow or the Stripe product so support cases are not necessary. These are just a few examples.
Responsibilities

Build, operate, and improve support products for all of Stripes users, from one-person startups to Premium Support users and large enterprises.
Work side-by-side with user-facing teams to understand their needs, develop short-term and long-term solutions, and deploy those solutions across our global 247 support operation.
Improve the internal tools that empower our user-facing teams to build new case-solving workflows, publish dynamic, localized content to our user-facing support site, and answer every support request with the right context for any user.
Own problems from end to end, managing complexity and engaging directly with stakeholders to think through everything from business impact, to reliability and operability, to the pixel-perfection of individual support interactions.
Uphold Stripes high standards for engineering and product quality and mentor newer team members to do the same. 

Who you are
Were looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.
Were looking for people passionate about distilling complexity to solve real world business problems.
Minimum requirements

You have a strong technical background, including 5 years of experience building impactful products or systems at scale
Enjoy being a generalist working on both the frontend, backend, and anything it takes to solve problems and delight users both internally and externally
Write high quality code that is tested thoroughly, supported by clear documentation and has appropriate production observability
You are empathetic with users, both internal and external, and strive to create a better experience for all customers
Enjoyment in working with a diverse group of people with different expertise
Proven ability to stitch together many different services and processes together even if you have not worked with them before
Uphold best practices in engineering, security, and design

Preferred qualifications

Proficient in JavaScript React  Ruby; language can be learned and we care much more about your general engineering skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework
Experience with integrating RESTful APIs into web applications.
Previous experience building engineering solutions focused on support

https://startup.jobs/full-stack-engineer-sprinto-3990205,Engineer,Full-Stack Engineer,Sprinto ,"Bengaluru, India",,"

What is Sprinto?

Sprinto is an early-stage SaaS startup, working in the information security ""compliance"" space. This is a flourishing area but has not seen any innovation in the last couple of decades. Thanks to some macro-changes, we think the space is ripe for a startup to become a market leader. Our job as founders and founding engineers is to ensure that Sprinto has a shot at this opportunity.

Why work with us?

Sprinto has an experienced founding team. Prior to Sprinto, we Girish and Raghu built Recruiterbox.com. We bootstrapped the recruiter box from 2011 to 2017 and scaled it to 2500 global customers and a team of 45 people spread across India and the US. At the end of 2017, Recruiterbox was acquired by TurnRiver capital.

We wrote most of the early code at Recruiterbox and remained among the top 5 committers even when the company ran at scale. We program because we love to, and understand the importance of good programming practices. At Recruiterbox, we adopted practices like writing unit tests, integration tests, CI, CD very early in our journey.

We believe good engineering breeds good results - rapid development, low tech debt, easy maintainability, etc. Our current choice of tech stack can be an interesting point of conversation when we meet.

Sprinto is well-capitalized by top-notch investors like Elevation, Accel and Blume. While you have all the advantages of working on challenging problems that come with working in a startup, you also dont have the risk of the company running out of money.

You will get to work with seasoned programmers who care about their craft and engineering culture

Last but not the least, stock options. While all early-stage startups offer stock options, not all of them are the same. At Sprinto, we arent satisfied with being just a largesuccessful company. We want to be the category leader. On a good outcome, your stint with Sprinto will leave you with no need to work for money and you only continue to work for passion.

What are we looking for?

You are a hands-on programmer and have professionally programmed for at least 2 years, preferably building web applications.

You have good problem-solving and communication skills, both spoken and written.

You are a quick learner and prefer picking up tools  languages as needed for solving the problem at hand in the best way possible

It helps if youve lived with the consequences of bad programming choices. You have an eye for spotting premature over-engineering that needlessly delays projects, but also notice when something that sounds fasteasytempting today will cost us severely in a few months.

You understand that, ultimately, Code is a means of solving the businesscustomer problems, and thrive in making the trade-offs that solve such problems efficiently.
